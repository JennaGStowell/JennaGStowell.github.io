        <div class="subheading mb-5">Dancer ðŸŒ±</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Jenna Stowell is currently a fourth year undergraduate at the University of California Riverside majoring in dance with a focus on dance making.  She has been dancing for seven years, and has had one year of introductory choreography classes under Professor Daeun Jung and Professor Toni Pasion.  Jenna currently dances at Aloha Hula Studio to further her practice in Oceana and Filipino dance studies. Jenna was also a part of Aloha Hula Studios Pasion Dance Company for the companyâ€™s first season in 2024.  Jenna is currently doing a mentorship with Toni Pasion at University of California Riverside to expand her education with dance.  Jenna was a part of Serrano High Schoolâ€™s competitive show choir, velocity, from 2017-2020 and became a dance captain her junior year of high school.  From 2020-2021, Jenna was in the advanced show choir Vocal Point and was a dance captain for that ensemble.  Jenna was on Serrano's dance team from 2018-2019 and performed with them for school shows and sportâ€™s games.  Jenna also participated in her high school musicals from 2017-2020 performing in Shrek the Musical, Once on This Island, and The Aadams Family.  Jenna has also diversified her styles since studying dance at the University of California Riverside by taking West African with Professor Clydean Parker, Introduction to African Dance with Professor Collete Eloi, Ballet with Professor Brandon J, Introduction to Latin Social Dances with Professor Patricia Huerta, Modern Dance with Daeun Jung, and has studied Hula for four quarters with Professor Toni Pasion.  She is passionate about learning and dance and wants to create pieces that resonate with her audience, and that are meaningful.  She wants to continue strengthening her dance technique and continue training to become a better dancer but also help her in furthering her education in dance.  She has choreographed for University of California Riverside's show Spring Forward.  She will also be choreographing for that show again in the year 2025, as well as UCR is Dancing which is another University of California Riverside show that happens in winter 2025.  Jenna is a diverse dancer having experience in hip-hop, contemporary, jazz, musical theater, west african, hula, modern, and others.  She is wanting to continue her education at University of California Riverside and go through the MFA program for experimental choreography.  She has hopes of becoming a University Professor for dance and being able to create positive dance spaces that allow for growth and creativity to fill the classroom.  She also would like to continue performing throughout her life and would love any opportunity that she gets to dance.  She wants to change the way dance spaces are because not all dance spaces are positive and inclusive for people but she wants to make sure anyone who wants to dance has an opportunity to do so.  Dance is a big part of her and she wants it to stay that way.
